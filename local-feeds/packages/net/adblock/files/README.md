# DNS based ad/abuse domain blocking

## Description
A lot of people already use adblocker plugins within their desktop browsers, but what if you are using your (smart) phone, tablet, watch or any other (wlan) gadget!? Getting rid of annoying ads, trackers and other abuse sites (like facebook) is simple: block them with your router. When the DNS server on your router receives DNS requests, you will sort out queries that ask for the resource records of ad servers and return a simple 'NXDOMAIN'. This is nothing but **N**on-e**X**istent Internet or Intranet domain name, if domain name is unable to resolved using the DNS server, a condition called the 'NXDOMAIN' occurred.

* Blocklist source parsing by fast & flexible regex rulesets
* Overall duplicate removal in central blocklist `adb_list.overall`
* Additional blacklist for manual overrides, located by default in `/etc/adblock/adblock.blacklist` or in LuCI
* Additional whitelist for manual overrides, located by default in `/etc/adblock/adblock.whitelist` or in LuCI
* Quality checks during blocklist update to ensure a reliable DNS backend service
* Minimal status & error logging to syslog, enable debug logging to receive more output
* procd based init system support (`start/stop/restart/reload/suspend/resume/query/status`)
* procd network interface trigger support or classic time based startup
* Keep the DNS cache intact after adblock processing (currently supported by unbound, named and kresd)
* Suspend & resume adblock actions temporarily without blocklist reloading
* Provide comprehensive runtime information via LuCI or via `status` init command
* Provide a detailed DNS Query Report with DNS related information about client requests, top (blocked) domains and more
* Provide a query function to quickly identify blocked (sub-)domains, e.g. for whitelisting. This function is also able to search in adblock backups and black-/whitelist, to get back the set of blocking lists sources for a certain domain
* Option to force DNS requests to the local resolver
* Automatic blocklist backup & restore, these backups will be used in case of download errors and during startup
* Send notification emails in case of a processing error or if the overall domain count is &le; 0
* Add new adblock sources on your own, see example below
* Strong LuCI support for all options

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
* [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org), tested with the stable release series (19.07) and with the latest snapshot
* A usual setup with an enabled DNS backend at minimum - dump AP modes without a working DNS backend are _not_ supported
* A download utility:
    * To support all blocklist sources and in order to run the default configuration of `adblock`, a full version (with SSL support) of `wget`, `uclient-fetch` with one of the `libustream-*` SSL libraries, `aria2c` or `curl` is required
        * The package used by default is probably `uclient-fetch` so in order to make `adblock` work with its default configuration it is needed to install one of the `libustream-*` SSL libraries. Example: `opkg install libustream-openssl`
    * For limited devices with real memory constraints, adblock provides also a `http only` option and supports `wget-nossl` and `uclient-fetch` (without `libustream-ssl`) as well
    * For more configuration options see examples below
* Email notification (optional): For email notification support you need the additional `msmtp` package
* DNS Query Report (optional): For this detailed report you need the additional package `tcpdump` or `tcpdump-mini`

### Installation of the core package
* Install `adblock` (`opkg install adblock`)

### LuCI adblock companion package
* It is strongly recommended to use the LuCI frontend to easily configure all powerful aspects of adblock
* Install `luci-app-adblock` (`opkg install luci-app-adblock`)
* The application is located in LuCI under the `Services` menu

### Configuration and controlling
* At minimum configure the appropriate DNS backend (`dnsmasq` by default), the download utility and enable the adblock service in `/etc/config/adblock`
* Control the adblock service manually with `/etc/init.d/adblock` `start/stop/restart/reload/suspend/resume/status` or use the LuCI frontend

#### Tweaks
* **Runtime information:** The adblock status is available via `/etc/init.d/adblock status` (see example below)
* **Debug logging:** For script debugging please set the config option `adb\_debug` to `1` and check the runtime output with `logread -e "adblock"`
* **Storage expansion:** To process and store all blocklist sources at once it might be helpful to enlarge your temp directory with a swap partition => see [OpenWrt Wiki](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/storage/fstab) for further details
* **coreutils sort:** To speedup adblock processing in particular with many enabled blocklist sources it is recommended to install the additional package `coreutils-sort`
* **Add white- / blacklist entries:** Add domain black- or whitelist entries to always-deny or -allow certain (sub) domains, by default both lists are empty and located in `/etc/adblock`. Please add one domain per line - ip addresses, wildcards & regex are _not_ allowed (see example below). You need to refresh your blocklists after changes to these static lists.
* **Download queue size:** For further download & list processing performance improvements you can raise the `adb\_maxqueue` value, e.g. `8` or `16` should be safe
* **Scheduled list updates:** For a scheduled call of the adblock service add an appropriate crontab entry (see example below)
* **Change startup behaviour:** By default the startup will be triggered by the `wan` procd interface trigger. Choose `none` to disable automatic startups, `timed` to use a classic timeout (default 30 sec.) or select another trigger interface
* **Suspend & resume adblocking:** To quickly switch the adblock service `on` or `off`, simply use `/etc/init.d/adblock [suspend|resume]`
* **Domain query:** To query the active blocklist for a certain domain, please use the LuCI frontend or run _/etc/init.d/adblock query `<DOMAIN>`_ (see example below)
* **Add new list sources:** You can add new blocklist sources on your own via uci config, all you need is a source url and an awk one-liner (see example below)

#### Further adblock config options

#### Examples
**Change default DNS backend to `unbound`:**

Adblock deposits the final blocklist `adb_list.overall` in `/var/lib/unbound` where unbound can find them in its jail, no further configuration needed.  
To preserve the DNS cache after adblock processing you need to install `unbound-control`.

**Change default DNS backend to `named` (bind):**

Adblock deposits the final blocklist `adb_list.overall` in `/var/lib/bind`.  
To preserve the DNS cache after adblock processing you need to install & configure `bind-rdnc`.  
To use the blocklist please modify `/etc/bind/named.conf`:
* In the `options` namespace add:
```
  response-policy { zone "rpz"; };
```
* And at the end of the file add:
```
  zone "rpz" {
    type master;
    file "/var/lib/bind/adb_list.overall";
    allow-query { none; };
    allow-transfer { none; };
  };
```

**Change default DNS backend to `kresd`:**

The knot-resolver (kresd) is only available on Turris Omnia devices.  
Adblock deposits the final blocklist `adb_list.overall` in `/etc/kresd`, no further configuration needed.
  
**Enable email notification via msmtp:**

To use the email notification you have to install & configure the package `msmtp`.  
Modify the file `/etc/msmtprc`:
```
[...]
defaults
auth            on
tls             on
tls_certcheck   off
timeout         5
syslog          LOG_MAIL
[...]
account         adb_notify
host            smtp.gmail.com
port            587
from            dev.adblock@gmail.com
user            dev.adblock
password        xxx
```
Finally enable email support and add a valid email address in LuCI.

**Cronjob for regular block list updates (`/etc/crontabs/root`):**

The following command as a cron job updates each individual block list from their source so that they hold the most current domains to block:
```
0 06 * * *    /etc/init.d/adblock reload
```
  
**Blacklist entry (`/etc/adblock/adblock.blacklist`):**

```
ads.example.com

This entry blocks the following (sub)domains:
  http://ads.example.com/foo.gif
  http://server1.ads.example.com/foo.gif

**Add a new blocklist source:**

1. The easy way ...  
Example: https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/rolist+easylist.txt  
Adblock already supports an easylist source, called 'reg_ru'. To add the additional local easylist as a new source, copy the existing config source section and change only the source name, the url and the description - that's all!
```
config source 'reg_ro'
  option enabled '0'
  option adb_src 'https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/rolist+easylist.txt'
  option adb_src_rset 'BEGIN{FS=\"[|^]\"}/^\|\|([^([:space:]|#|\*|\/).]+\.)+[[:alpha:]]+\^("\\\$third-party")?$/{print tolower(\$3)}'
  option adb_src_desc 'focus on romanian ads plus generic easylist additions, weekly updates, approx. 9.400 entries'
```

2. A bit harder ...  
To add a really new source with different domain/host format you have to write a suitable awk one-liner on your own, so basic awk skills are needed. As a starting point check the already existing awk rulesets `adb_src_rset` in the config file, probably you need only small changes for your individual list. Download the desired list and test your new awk string locally. The output result should be a sequential list with one domain/host per line - nothing more. If your awk one-liner works quite well, add a new source section to the adblock config file and test the new source.
